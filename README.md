## White Smoke

### Description
  White smoke in triangle on page with a fading and reappearing effect.

##Colorful Smoke

### Description
  Colorful smoke animation (inspired by the book 'Okiem m≈Çodego poety' by Adrian Jasek) with a fading and reappearing effect.

## Clouds without image

### Description
  Realistic cloud created using CSS and HTML.
    
### Mistakes
  It doesn't look as good as [Clouds And Stars]. You can improve performance by using the `opacity` property in CSS.

## Clouds And Stars
  ### Description
  Realistic cloud and stars movement created using CSS and HTML.
    
  ### Mistakes
  I used many `<span>` elements. You can reduce them and adjust the `margin` value. Decreasing the number of `<span>` elements will result in fewer stars.
    
## Black Smoke

  ### Description
  Black smoke in triangle on page with a fading and reappearing effect.

## Future
This repository is a work in progress. More animations will be added in the future, and existing animations will be refined.

# How To Use It

To insert this animation, you need to copy the code from the `<body>` element and CSS, and then paste it into your project.
