## Clouds And Stars
  ### Description
  Realistic cloud and stars movement created using CSS and HTML.
    
  ### Mistakes
  I used many `<span>` elements. You can reduce them and adjust the `margin` value. Decreasing the number of `<span>` elements will result in fewer stars.
    
## Black Smoke
  ### Description
  Black smoke in triangle on page. 
    
  ### Mistakes
  The current animation doesn't maintain a clear loop; instead, it abruptly changes direction, resulting in a noticeable transition for the user. Achieving a smooth and continuous loop for the smoke animation is a challenge that requires further refinement.

## Future
This repository is a work in progress. More animations will be added in the future, and existing animations will be refined.
