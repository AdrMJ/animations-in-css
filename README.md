## Clouds And Stars
  ### Description
  Realistic cloud and stars movement created using CSS and HTML.
    
  ### Mistakes
  I used many `<span>` elements. You can reduce them and adjust the `margin` value. Decreasing the number of `<span>` elements will result in fewer stars.

## Future
This repository is a work in progress. More animations will be added in the future, and existing animations will be refined.

## How To Use It

To insert this animation, you need to copy the code from the `<body>` element and CSS, and then paste it into your project.
