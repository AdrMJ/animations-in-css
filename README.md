## Clouds without image

### Description
  Realistic cloud created using CSS and HTML.
    
### Mistakes
  It doesn't look as good as [Clouds And Stars]. You can improve performance by using the `opacity` property in CSS.
  
## Future
This repository is a work in progress. More animations will be added in the future, and existing animations will be refined.

## How To Use It

To insert this animation, you need to copy the code from the `<body>` element and CSS, and then paste it into your project.
